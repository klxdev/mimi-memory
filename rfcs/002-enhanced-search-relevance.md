# 002: Enhanced Search Relevance

## Status

Implemented

## Summary

Improve memory retrieval accuracy by refining vector search logic, implementing entity-based boosting, and optimizing similarity score calculations.

## Motivation

Current search results return low similarity scores (often negative) and frequently appear unrelated to the user's query. This is likely due to the use of L2 distance for scoring and a lack of semantic boosting for key entities.

## Requirements (EARS Format)

### Ubiquitous

- The SearchEngine shall use the same embedding model for queries as was used for storing memories.

### Event-driven

- When a search is initiated, the SearchEngine shall use Cosine similarity to rank memories.
- When a search is initiated, the SearchEngine shall normalize similarity scores to a 0.0 to 1.0 range.

### Unwanted Behavior

- If the embedding provider fails, the SearchEngine shall log a warning and return an empty result set.
- If the database table does not exist, the SearchEngine shall return an empty result set without throwing an error.

### State-driven

- While a `boostEntity` is provided, the SearchEngine shall resolve the entity name to an ID and increase the score of memories associated with that entity ID.

### Optional Features

- Where a `minScore` threshold is provided, the SearchEngine shall exclude results with a score below the threshold.

## Detailed Design

### 1. Vector Search Optimization

- Update `Repository.searchMemories` to use `distanceType("cosine")` in LanceDB queries.
- Update `SearchEngine.search` to handle similarity scores correctly (Cosine distance is converted to similarity: `1 - distance`).
- Scores are normalized to `[0, 1]` using `(similarity + 1) / 2`.

### 2. Entity Boosting

- In `SearchEngine.search`, if `boostEntity` is provided (supports multiple names):
  - Query the `entities` table for entities matching the names (case-insensitive).
  - For each search result, if `r.entityIds` contains any of the boosted entity IDs, multiply its score by a hardcoded boost factor of **1.2**.

### 3. Consistency

- Ensure `SearchEngine` and `PipelineEngine` use a consistent logic for selecting the embedding provider.

## Drawbacks

- Entity lookup adds an extra database query per search if boosting is used.
- Boosting might slightly favor older memories if entity associations are more frequent there.

## Alternatives

- Use an LLM for reranking (more accurate but slower and more expensive).
- Use hybrid search (vector + keyword), but LanceDB's keyword search setup is more complex.

## Unresolved Questions

- None. (Multiple entities support and hardcoded 1.2 boost factor decided).
